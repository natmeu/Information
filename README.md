Information about Repositories

As required by the North Carolina State University Office of Student Conduct, all assignment and project artifacts are required to be pushed to private repositories in order to maintain academic integrity. To view the contents of the repository for recruitement/interview purposes, please send me an email (natvmeu@gmail.com) and I will grant access.

The following projects are available:
- Order Fulfillment & Inventory Management Application (Java, HTML, AngularJS, APIs, MySQL, Spring, Maven): coffee shop order fullfillment application with order ahead, inventory management, and customer/staff logins.
- Course Scheduling Manager (Java): manages course scheduling for a university, allowing students to register for classes, faculty to register to teach classes, and administrators to manage overall scheduling.
- Trip Planning Manager (C): route generation application, providing information on distance, location, etc. for each destination.
- DES Encryption Decryption (C): implemented the DES encryption method to encrypt/decrypt a file with a specified key.

Thank you!
