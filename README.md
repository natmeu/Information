Information about Repositories

As required by the North Carolina State University Office of Student Conduct, all assignment and project artifacts are required to be pushed to private repositories in order to maintain academic integrity. To view the contents of the repository for recruitement/interview purposes, please send me an email (natvmeu@gmail.com) and I will grant access.

The following projects are available:
- Meal Prep Application (HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, REST, Node.js, Express, Docker, MariaDB): meal prep planning application with recipe organization, shopping list generation, and unique user logins.
- Order Fulfillment & Inventory Management Application (Java, HTML, AngularJS, APIs, MySQL, Spring, Maven): coffee shop order fullfillment application with order ahead, inventory management, and customer/staff logins.
- Course Scheduling Manager (Java): manages course scheduling for a university, allowing students to register for classes, faculty to register to teach classes, and administrators to manage overall scheduling.
- Trip Planning Manager (C): route generation application, providing information on distance, location, etc. for each destination.

The Augmented Reality Protein Dynamics Learning Tool is the property of the stakeholders (Wake Tech Community College) and cannot be made available.
