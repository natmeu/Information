Information about Repositories

As required by the North Carolina State University Office of Student Conduct, all assignment and project artifacts are required to be pushed to private repositories in order to maintain academic integrity. To view the contents of the repository for recruitement/interview purposes, please send me an email (natvmeu@gmail.com) and I will grant access.

The following projects are available:
- Course Scheduling Manager (Java): manages the scheduling of students to courses with designated student/professor/admin log ins to control how classes are assigned and handled.
- Trip Planning Manager (C): allows the user to get information about various North Carolina state parks and plan a trip to one or more parks.
- DES Encryption Decryption (C): encrypt/decrypt a file using the DES method and a specified key.

Thank you!
